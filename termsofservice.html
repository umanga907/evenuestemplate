            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the eVenues website (the "Website"). This Website is
              provided solely to assist Customers in gathering meeting venue
              information, determining the availability and eventual
              compatibility of meeting-related goods and services with venue
              providers (“Providers”); to assist Providers in creating and
              managing Listings and bookings for their venues; and for no other
              purposes. eVenues will not be a party to any eventual contract
              made between the venue Provider and the Customer. The terms "We",
              "Us", "our", “eVenues” and "eVenues.com" refer to eVenues, Inc.
              (d/b/a eVenues Group, Inc.), a State of Delaware corporation. The
              term "you" or “User” refers to the user visiting the eVenues
              website (the “Website”), and the term “Customer” refers to a user
              reviewing Listings and/or booking a reservation through the
              Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance
              without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set
              forth below (collectively, the "Agreement"). By accessing or using
              the Website in any manner, you agree to be bound by this
              Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully. If you do not
              accept all of these terms and conditions, please do not use the
              Website. We reserve the right at any time, at our sole discretion,
              to change or otherwise modify this Agreement without prior notice,
              and your continued access to or use of the Website signifies your
              acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. Be sure to return
              to this page periodically to review the most current version of
              the Agreement.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of the website</h2>
            <p>As a condition of your use of the Website, you warrant that:</p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You are at least 18 years of age;</li>
              <li>
                You will use the Website in accordance with this Agreement;
              </li>
              <li>
                You will only use the Website to make legitimate inquiries for
                you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to
                act;
              </li>
              <li>
                All information supplied by you on the Website is known to be
                true, accurate, current and complete, maintained by the
                Provider.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to
              anyone to the Website and the services we offer, at any time and
              for any reason, including, but not limited to, violation of this
              Agreement or any applicable law, rule, or regulation
            </p>
            <h2>Evenues Enquires</h2>
            <p>
              By reading and acknowledging this Agreement, you understand that
              eVenues is a service provider that facilitates the inquiries of
              reservations by allowing Providers to post Listings containing
              facility rates and locations and allowing Customers to make
              inquiries through the Website. eVenues provides online searching,
              ratings &amp; reviews, and marketing automation on behalf of the
              Providers, but this does not make eVenues a party to any agreement
              made between a Customer and a Provider, including but not limited
              to a Rental agreement or any landlord-tenant relationship arising
              between a Customer and a Provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              When making an inquiry on the Website, you are not making a
              reservation, but checking on eventual date availability. You
              understand that eVenues is not a co-vendor with the venue Provider
              and that you will pay the Provider directly and need to agree to a
              separate contract to complete the reservation. You agree to
              payment of the total reservation price including the facilities
              rate displayed on the Website and any associated service fees.
              Note other taxes, including but not limited to city and local
              hospitality taxes, will be included in the final Provider
              contract.
            </p>
            <h2>Pricing and payment</h2>
            <p>
              Pricing is determined on fair market pricing decided by the
              facilities Provider. Generally, pricing will be by the hour or day
              (e.g. $50 per hour or $300 per day). The Provider sets the price
              when registering its venue profile on the Website. The Provider
              reserves the right to make changes to the price.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes and refunds</h2>
            <p>
              All refunds or changes must be made through the Provider. eVenues
              will not make or process refunds on either the transaction or
              associated service fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Changes or cancellation requirements and penalties vary by
              Provider. You agree to pay any Provider any cancellation or change
              fees as agreed between you and the Provider. Further, you agree to
              abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your
              prepaid venue reservations.
            </p>
            <h2>Venue provider agreements rules and restrictions</h2>
            <p>
              A separate agreement will apply to your reservation and/or
              purchase of facilities and related services from a Provider. This
              separate agreement will be presented to you at the time of payment
              and your acceptance is a condition of your reservation. Please
              read this separate agreement carefully. You agree to abide by the
              terms and conditions imposed by any Provider with whom you elect
              to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts
              when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions
              regarding availability and use of the facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge that Providers offering certain services and/or
              activities may require you to agree to their separate agreement
              prior to participating in the service and/or activity. You
              understand that any violation of any such supplier's terms, rules,
              or restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s),
              denied access to the applicable meeting venue product or services,
              forfeiture of any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or
              debiting of your account for any costs incurred by eVenues as a
              result of such violation.
            </p>

              The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, found at 17 U.S.C. §
              512 ("DMCA"), provides recourse for owners of copyrighted
              materials who believe that their rights under United States
              copyright law have been infringed upon on the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the DMCA, the bona fide owner of copyrighted materials who
              has a good faith belief that their copyright has been infringed
              may contact not only the person or entity infringing on their
              copyright, but may also contact the designated agent of an
              Internet service provider to report alleged infringements of their
              protected works, when such alleged infringements appear on pages
              contained within the system of the Internet service provider
              (“ISP”).

            <p>
              eVenues is committed to complying with all United States laws,
              including United States copyright law. Upon receipt of a properly
              filed complaint under the DMCA, the owner will block access to the
              allegedly infringing material. The website owner will forward a
              copy of the notification of claimed copyright infringement to the
              alleged infringer. Anyone who believes in good faith that a notice
              of copyright infringement has wrongfully been filed against them
              may submit a Counter-notice to the website owner.
            </p>
            <h2>Infringment notification procedures</h2>
            <p>
              If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by eVenues
              infringe upon your copyright or other intellectual property
              rights, you may file a notice of infringement. To file a notice of
              infringement, you must provide a written communication that sets
              forth the items specified below. You will be liable for damages
              (including damages, costs, and attorneys' fees) if you materially
              misrepresent that the Website or Website content is infringing
              your intellectual property. Accordingly, if you are not sure
              whether certain material of yours is protected by copyright or
              other laws, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
            </p>
            <p>
              To expedite the process please include the following information
              in your written notice of infringement:

                infringing upon your copyright).

                behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
                infringed. I also affirm that as the copyright owner, I have a
                good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
                complained of is not authorized by me, my agent, or the law."
                [Please note that a recent court decision has indicated that
                your good faith belief should include a consideration of “Fair

            <h2>Govering Law</h2>
            <p>
              This Website is operated by a U.S. entity and this Agreement is
              governed by the laws of the State of Washington, USA. You hereby
              consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in King
              County, Washington, USA, in all disputes arising out of or
              relating to the use of the Website. Use of the Website is
              unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all
              provisions of these terms and conditions, including, without
              limitation, this paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and
              legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement limits our
              right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or
              legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Website
              or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such
              use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you
              will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating
              to your access or use of the Website within two (2) years from the
              date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim
              or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or
              unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not
              limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
              forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
              deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
              closely matches the intent of the original provision and Agreement
              shall continue in effect.
            </p>
            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>
              This Agreement (and any other terms and conditions referenced
              herein) constitutes the entire agreement between you and eVenues
              with respect to the Website and it supersedes all prior or
              contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic,
              oral, or written, between the customer and eVenues with respect to
              the Website or any eVenues services. A printed version of this
              Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
              admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
              relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the
              same conditions as other business documents and records originally
              generated and maintained in printed form. This Agreement may not
              be modified orally.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, or employment
              relationship exists between you and eVenues as a result of this
              Agreement or use of the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              A delay on the part of either Party in the exercise of its rights
              or remedies will not operate as a waiver of such rights or
              remedies, and a single or partial exercise by a Party of any such
              rights or remedies will not preclude other or further exercises of
              that right or remedy. A waiver of a right or remedy on any one
              occasion will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of those
              rights or remedies on any other occasion.
